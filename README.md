# Website for Joe Koebbe,
### Department of Mathematics and Statistics at USU

This site is maintained to offer people access to applications I have written over the past years. There are a lot of codes that 
I have written in a variety of languages. For example, I wrote a basic black oil simulator for my dissertation many years ago on
a pair of DEC VAX machines at the Univerisity of Wyoming in Fortran 77. Another project involves the simulation of the Gambler's
Ruin problem written in Java. The code for all projects that I have completed (or mostly completed) are freely available to all
who want to use the codes responsibly.

Please note that the codes are provided with no warantee or any other guarantees. You are welcome to modify the code, but do not
expect me to modify codes to meet your needs. However, I will likely not make huge changes to other codes unless the
modifications are for bugs or problems with the existing codes.
