# Main Github Website for Joe Koebbe,
### Department of Mathematics and Statistics at USU

This site is maintained to offer people access to applications I have written over the past years. There are a lot of codes that 
I have written in a variety of languages. For example, I wrote a basic black oil simulator (approximately 350,000 lines of Fortran
77 code) for my dissertation many years ago on a pair of DEC VAX machines at the Univerisity of Wyoming in Fortran 77. Another 
project involves the simulation of the Gambler's Ruin problem written in Java. The code for all projects that I have completed (or
mostly completed) are freely available to all who want to use the codes responsibly.

Please note that the codes are provided with no warranty or any other guarantees. You are welcome to modify the code, but do not
expect me to modify codes to meet your needs or to correct problems that have occured due to modifications you have made to the 
existing codes. However, I will likely not make huge changes to other codes unless the modifications are for bugs or problems 
with existing codes that have some problem with the underlying logic or mathematics (or something like that). Note that I am a
bit new to Github and some of these links are still being filled in. Please bit patient if you click on a link and there is no
page on the other end.
