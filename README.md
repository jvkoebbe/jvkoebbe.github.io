### Repositories for Classes Currently Taught or Taught in the Past

For some of the classes taught at USU, course materials have been posted on Github. The following links will take the interested
user user to several courses. These are basic links. If you are interested in the contents, find the syllabus for each of these
courses. A good share of the links for classes will take you Joe's web site at USU.

1. [Math 4610 Materials](https://jvkoebbe.github.io/math4610)
1. [Math 2280 ODEs (fall 2017)](http://www.math.usu.edu/~koebbe/teaching/courses/math2280/materials.html)
2. [Math 4610 Fund. of Comp. Math (fall 2017)](http://www.math.usu.edu/~koebbe/teaching/courses/Math4610/materials.html)

### Repositories Related to Specific Projects

Some materials developed from classes have resulted in repositories for specific applications. These are listed in this section.
As more of these are created the list will become longer. Note that the applications may be in a variety of programming 
languages. For example, the Gamblers Ruin application is written in Java. The use of Java was determined a number of years ago
when the object was built for a course taught at USU.
